# AI Agent Instructions

This document provides key context to help AI coding assistants be productive in this codebase.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new project focused on contract management. The architecture and patterns will evolve as the project grows.

## Key Directories

The project currently has the following structure:

- `.github/` - GitHub configuration and documentation
- More directories will be added as the project develops

## Developer Workflows 

As the project matures, key workflows for building, testing, and deploying will be documented here.

## Project Conventions

Project-specific conventions and patterns will be documented here as they emerge during development.

## Integration Points

External integrations, APIs, and cross-component communication patterns will be documented here.

Note: This is an initial scaffold for AI assistant instructions. The content should be expanded as:

1. Core architectural decisions are made
2. Development workflows are established  
3. Project-specific patterns emerge
4. Integration points are added

Please update this document as those aspects of the project take shape.
